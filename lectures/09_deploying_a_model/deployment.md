## Deploying a Model is Easy

Model inference component as function/library

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = … # learn model or load serialized model ...
def infer(feature1, feature2):
    return model.predict(np.array([[feature1, feature2]])
```

----
## Deploying a Model is Easy

Model inference component as a service


```python
from flask import Flask, escape, request
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = '/tmp/uploads'
detector_model = … # load model…

# inference API that returns JSON with classes 
# found in an image
@app.route('/get_objects', methods=['POST'])
def pred():
    uploaded_img = request.files["images"]
    coverted_img = … # feature encoding of uploaded img
    result = detector_model(converted_img)
    return jsonify({"response":
                result['detection_class_entities']})

```

----
## Deploying a Model is Easy

Packaging a model inference service in a container

## Analysis-Specific Abstractions

All maps were abstractions of the same real-world construct

All maps were created with different goals in mind
   - Different relevant abstractions
   - Different reasoning opportunities
 
Architectural models are specific system abstractions, for reasoning about specific qualities

No uniform notation

## System Qualities of Interest?

<!-- discussion -->


---
# Design Decision: Selecting ML Algorithms

What ML algorithms to use and why? Tradeoffs?

![](googletranslate.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


Notes: Relate back to previous lecture about AI technique tradeoffs, including for example
Accuracy
Capabilities (e.g. classification, recommendation, clustering…)
Amount of training data needed
Inference latency
Learning latency; incremental learning?
Model size
Explainable? Robust?

---
# Design Decision: Where Should the Model Live?

(Deployment Architecture)

----
## Where Should the Models Live?

![AR Translation Architecture Sketch](ar-architecture.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

Cloud? Phone? Glasses?

What qualities are relevant for the decision?

Notes: Trigger initial discussion


----
## Considerations

* How much data is needed as input for the model?
* How much output data is produced by the model?
* How fast/energy consuming is model execution?
* What latency is needed for the application?
* How big is the model? How often does it need to be updated?
* Cost of operating the model? (distribution + execution)
* Opportunities for telemetry?
* What happens if users are offline?

----
## Breakout: Latency and Bandwidth Analysis


1. Estimate latency and bandwidth requirements between components
2. Discuss tradeoffs among different deployment models


![AR Translation Architecture Sketch](ar-architecture.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain stretch" -->


As a group, post in `#lecture` tagging group members:
* Recommended deployment for OCR (with justification):
* Recommended deployment for Translation (with justification):



Notes: Identify at least OCR and Translation service as two AI components in a larger system. Discuss which system components are worth modeling (e.g., rendering, database, support forum). Discuss how to get good estimates for latency and bandwidth.

Some data:
200ms latency is noticable as speech pause; 
20ms is perceivable as video delay, 10ms as haptic delay;
5ms referenced as cybersickness threshold for virtual reality
20ms latency might be acceptable

bluetooth latency around 40ms to 200ms

bluetooth bandwidth up to 3mbit, wifi 54mbit, video stream depending on quality 4 to 10mbit for low to medium quality

google glasses had 5 megapixel camera, 640x360 pixel screen, 1 or 2gb ram, 16gb storage

## From the Reading: When would one use the following designs?

* Static intelligence in the product
* Client-side intelligence (user-facing devices)
* Server-centric intelligence
* Back-end cached intelligence
* Hybrid models
*
* Consider: Offline use, inference latency, model updates, application updates, operating cost, scalability, protecting intellectual property


Notes:
From the reading:
* Static intelligence in the product
    - difficult to update
    - good execution latency
    - cheap operation
    - offline operation
    - no telemetry to evaluate and improve
* Client-side intelligence
    - updates costly/slow, out of sync problems
    - complexity in clients
    - offline operation, low execution latency
* Server-centric intelligence
    - latency in model execution (remote calls)
    - easy to update and experiment
    - operation cost
    - no offline operation
* Back-end cached intelligence
    - precomputed common results
    - fast execution, partial offline 
    - saves bandwidth, complicated updates
* Hybrid models


----
## Where Should Feature Encoding Happen?

![Feature Encoding](featureencoding.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

*Should feature encoding happen server-side or client-side? Tradeoffs?*

Note: When thinking of model inference as a component within a system, feature encoding can happen with the model-inference component or can be the responsibility of the client. That is, the client either provides the raw inputs (e.g., image files; dotted box in the figure above) to the inference service or the client is responsible for computing features and provides the feature vector to the inference service (dashed box). Feature encoding and model inference could even be two separate services that are called by the client in sequence. Which alternative is preferable is a design decision that may depend on a number of factors, for example, whether and how the feature vectors are stored in the system, how expensive computing the feature encoding is, how often feature encoding changes, how many models use the same feature encoding, and so forth. For instance, in our stock photo example, having feature encoding being part of the inference service is convenient for clients and makes it easy to update the model without changing clients, but we would have to send the entire image over the network instead of just the much smaller feature vector for the reduced 300 x 300 pixels.


----
## Reusing Feature Engineering Code


![Feature encoding shared between training and inference](shared-feature-encoding.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain stretch" -->


Avoid *training–serving skew*

----
## The Feature Store Pattern

* Central place to store, version, and describe feature engineering code
* Can be reused across projects
* Possible caching of expensive features


Many open source and commercial offerings, e.g.,  Feast, Tecton, AWS SageMaker Feature Store

----
## Tecton Feature Store

----
## More Considerations for Deployment Decisions

Coupling of ML pipeline parts

Coupling with other parts of the system

Ability for different developers and analysts to collaborate

Support online experiments

Ability to monitor

# Documenting Model Inference Interfaces



----
## Why Documentation

Model inference between teams:
  * Data scientists developing the model
  * Other data scientists using the model, evolving the model
  * Software engineers integrating the model as a component
  * Operators managing model deployment

Will this model work for my problem?

What problems to anticipate?

----
## Classic API Documentation


```java
/**
 * compute deductions based on provided adjusted 
 * gross income and expenses in customer data.
 *
 * see tax code 26 U.S. Code A.1.B, PART VI
 */
float computeDeductions(float agi, Expenses expenses);
```



----
## What to document for models?

<!-- discussion -->

----
## Documenting Input/Output Types for Inference Components

```js
{
  "mid": string,
  "languageCode": string,
  "name": string,
  "score": number,
  "boundingPoly": {
    object (BoundingPoly)
  }
}
```
From Google’s public [object detection API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/object-localizer).

----
## Documentation beyond I/O Types

Intended use cases, model capabilities and limitations

Supported target distribution (vs preconditions)

Accuracy (various measures), incl. slices, fairness

Latency, throughput, availability (service level agreements)

Model qualities such as explainability, robustness, calibration

Ethical considerations (fairness, safety, security, privacy)


**Example for OCR model? How would you describe these?**

----
## Model Cards 

* Proposal and template for documentation from Google
  * Intended use, out-of-scope use
  * Training and evaluation data
  * Considered demographic factors
  * Accuracy evaluations
  * Ethical considerations
* 1-2 page summary
* Focused on fairness
* Widely discussed, but not frequently adopted

## FactSheets 

<div class="smallish">

Proposal and template for documentation from IBM; intended to communicate intended qualities and assurances

Longer list of criteria, including
  * Service intention, intended use
  * Technical description
  * Target distribution
  * Own and third-party evaluation results
  * Safety and fairness considerations, explainability
  * Preparation for drift and evolution
  * Security, lineage and versioning

----
## Recall: Correctness vs Fit

Without a clear specification a model is difficult to document

Need documentation to allow evaluation for *fit*

Description of *target distribution* is a key challenge
